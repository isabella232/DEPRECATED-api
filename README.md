## Support 

Running into issues? First take a look at our [devcenter section](http://devcenter.wercker.com/api/) related to the API. If that didn't help, open a issue. Include as much information as possible related to the problem with the issue.

## Feature requests

Do you want access to a certain resource? please open an issue with the desired resource, and optionally a small use-case describing why you want it. This won't guarantee that we will create it, but it will help with prioritizing new endpoints.
